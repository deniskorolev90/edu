This is Mr. Mathison. 
He's a doctor.

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,164
Are you OK?

4
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,527
An ambulance is on the way.

5
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,005
Thank you.

00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,564
Is there a name yet?

00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,729
Is he supposed to be 
crying like this?

00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,250
May I?

Can I have him back?

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:02,211
What happened during 
the delivery?

15
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,886
Nothing. It was very quick.

16
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,161
The baby just wanted
to come right out.

17
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,890
There were no problems.

18
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,481
Did you drop him?

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,722
What?

20
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,087
Did you drop this baby?

Jesus Christ, no.

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,209
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

23
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,090
- All right.
- Ma'am.

I've never seen... this.

[train enters tunnel]

Someone left this magazine.

38
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,408
Want to take a look at it?

39
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,131
Can I take a look at that one?

40
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,642
Thanks.

41
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,603
You like sports?

42
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,801
It's my field.

I represent athletes. 
I'm an agent.

Are you looking for any male
synchronized swimmers?

45
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,927
I'm thinking about getting 
into that.

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,570
Is that right?

47
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,966
I'm afraid of water.
Think that's a problem?

48
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,724
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

49
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,326
I'm meeting this player
from Temple University.

50
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,488
He's a cornerback.

51

This kid is 6'1", 210 pounds.

He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

Do you like football?

00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,362
Not really.

I'm married.

Great.

62
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,165
I'm sorry.

What are you talking about?

64
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,161
I think you misunderstood.

What I was...

66
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,649
...saying...
- I know.

67
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,366

I look classy too.

75
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,961
What about me?
Don't I look classy?

76
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,246
But I'm afraid you 
forgot... this!

77
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,526
And this!

78
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,524
[man] Where has you been, Banana?

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,881
[man 2] Now I've got you, Weasel.

We are not sure at this time

I'm Dr. Dubin.

You're in the emergency room
in the Philadelphia City Hospital.

97
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,529
You were in a serious accident.

Look at me.

How are you feeling?

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,001
- OK.
- Good.

101
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,651
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

102
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,651
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,886
No.

104
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,930
Kidney or renal problems?

105
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,166
No.

106
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,810
Any allergies?

107
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,409
No.

[monitor beeps faster]

109
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,606
Where were you sitting
on the train?

110
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,643
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

111
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,323
Yeah.

112
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,683
Where are the other passengers?

113
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,842
Was your family traveling 
with you?

114
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,169
No.

115
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,005
Did you get up from your seat?

116
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,564
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

117
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,161
Yes.

118
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,370
Why are you looking at me
like that?

119
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,528
Your train derailed.

120
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,245
Some kind of malfunction.

121
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,369
They only found
two people alive so far.

You and this man.

123
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,170
His skull was cracked open,

124
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,682
and most of his left side
was crushed.

125
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,690
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons

126
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,530
why I'm looking at you like this.

127
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,166
One, because it seems,
in a few minutes,

128
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,922
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

- And two...
- [monitor beeping rapidly]

130
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,406
...because you didn't
break one bone.

131
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,687
You don't have a scratch on you.

132

133

I'm still moving there.

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,049
Just...

139
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,361
Oh, just... just not now.

No, sir, he is not.

159
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,531
I read about you in the paper.

160
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,721
What?

161
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,041
I was in an accident once too.

162
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,851
A horse almost
trampled me to death.

- Had him put down.

That's a sad story.

165
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,722
Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

166
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,962
Proceed.

167
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,441
Ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken

168

Yes, ma'am.

170
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,491
Thank you.

171
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,604
- [rain falling]
- [people shouting]

172
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,884
[thunder rumbling]

173
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,049
[quarterback calling out]

174
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,881
[whistle blows]

175
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,403
Hey, Noel.

176
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,647
What, you hit your head 
on that train?

177
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,041
Get your brain to start 
working again?

178
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,889
What?

179
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,285
Forty dollars.

180
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,489
- Forty dollars what?
- You're getting a $40-a-week raise.

181
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,891
That's it.

182
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,604
I checked. You were right.

183
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,648
You've never taken a sick day.

184
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,566
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

185
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,602
Smart way to make your point.

186
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,281
[knock on door]

187
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,526
Is Joseph OK?

188
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,649
Yeah. He's asleep.

189
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,846
Oh.

190
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,571
Uh...

191
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,120
I wanted to ask you a question.

192
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,128
It's gonna sound a little strange,

193
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,131
but just think about it
for a second, OK?

194
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,446
OK.

195
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,128
When's the last time I was sick?

196
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,605
Do you remember?

197
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,808
Um, I don't know.

198
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,605
It's been a while.

199
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,287
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

200
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,527
OK.

201
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,728
Do you remember me getting sick?

202
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,524
Um...

203
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,647
Not a specific day.

204
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,729
What... what's this about?

205
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,681
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

206
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,843
In the three years
we lived in this house?

207
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,882
In the old apartment?

208
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,089
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

209
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,202
I... I can't remember.

210
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,527
Don't you think that's 
kind of weird,

211
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,770
not remembering one cold
or a fever or a sore throat?

212
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,882
What do you think it means?

213
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,330
Um...

214
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,770
I think it means probably
too tired to remember.

215
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,887
[footsteps approaching]

216
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,963
No more sitting in this room.

217
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,606
I let it go on long enough.

218
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,962
I'm not going out there anymore.
I'm not getting hurt again.

219
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,925
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

220
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,804
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

221
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,929
If that's what God has planned
for you, that's gonna happen.

222
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,770
You can't hide from it
sitting in a room.

223
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,001
They call me Mr. Glass 
at school

224
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,162
because I break like glass.

225
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,247
You make this decision now...

226
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,087
...to be afraid...

227
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,527
...and you will never turn back.

228
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,041
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

229
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,324
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

230
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,490
Forget why.

231
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,089
You want it or not?

232
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,761
Well, go get it, then.

233
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,080
Where is it?

234
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,125
On a bench...

235
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,044
...across the street.

236
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,241
[children chattering]

237
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,209
Someone's gonna take it.

238
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,410
Then you better
get out there soon.

239
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,011
[laughing, shouting]

240
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,443
I bought a whole bunch.

241
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,291
There'll be one of these
waiting for you

242
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,971
every time you want
to come out here.

243
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,249
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

244
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,005
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

245
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,768
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.

246
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,723
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

247
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,689
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,

248
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,643
common in most comic heroes.

249
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:25,526
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.

250
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,490
This again is common,
but only in villains.

251
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,851
Mmm.

252
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,042
The thing to notice about 
this piece,

253
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,250
the thing that makes it
very, very special

254
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,324
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

255
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,681
When the characters
reached the magazine,

256
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,802
they were exaggerated...

257
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,161
...as always happens.

258
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,046
This... is vintage.

259
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,846
Well...

260
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,320
...wrap it up.

261
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,045
You've made
a considerably wise decision.

262
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,362
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

263
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,409
Once again, please?

264
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,603
My son Jeb, it's a gift for him.

265
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,684
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

266
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,721
No.

267
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:32,600
No,no,ho,no,no.

268
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,890
You need to go. Now.

269
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,081
[scoffs]

270
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,282
What... what'd I say?

271
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,966
Do you see any Teletubbies 
in here?

272
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:45,281
Do you see
a slender plastic tag

273
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,091
clipped to my shirt
with my name printed on it?

274
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,130
An Asian child with a blank 
expression sitting outside

275
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,921
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

276
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,445
No?

277
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,602
Well, that's what you see
at a toy store,

278
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,648
and you must think
you're in a toy store

279
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,486
because you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

280
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,564
Now one of us
has made a gross error

281
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,649
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

282
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,007
This is an art gallery, 
my friend,

283
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,127
and this...

284
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,202
...is a piece of art.

285
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,645
We're by appointment only.

286
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,566
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations, you have a mailbox.

287
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,291
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

288
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,608
This one was under the 
windshield wiper of my car.

289
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,164
How certain are you
that you've never taken ill?

290
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,641
Seventy-five percent.

291
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,489
Well...

292
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,643
...that's not certain 
at all, is it?

293
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,206
That's hole number one.

294
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,921
I'm going to be extremely
skeptical about all this.

295
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,411
[David] About all what?

296
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,850
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

297
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,848
[Joseph] Dad's been injured.

298
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,888
Is the child correct?

299
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,083
Yes, sir.

300
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,367
In college, I was in a car accident.

301
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,207
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football anymore.

302
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,890
That's hole number two.

303
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,844
That's a big one.

304
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,481
Mr. Price, can we talk about the note
that you left on my car?

305
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,524
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

306
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,206
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed

307
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,363
with nothing else to do but read.

308
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,562
I believe comics are our last link

309
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,207
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

310
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,408
The Egyptians drew on the walls.

311
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,804
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

312
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,247
I believe comics
are a form of history

313
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,483
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

314
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,928
Then, of course, those experiences
and history got chewed up

315
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,442
in the commercial machine,
got jazzed up, made titillating,

316
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,329
cartooned for the sale rack.

317
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,088
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

318
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,640
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

319
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,411
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fire.

320
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,403
I watched the news waiting to hear

321
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,930
a very specific combination of words,
but they never came.

322
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,806
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident,

323
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,008
and I heard them.

324
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,082
"There is a sole survivor,

325
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:45,448
and he is miraculously unharmed."

326
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,682
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

327
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,049
It's a genetic disorder. I don't make
a particular protein very well,

328
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,691
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

329
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,001
Very easy to break.

330
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,651
I've had 54 breaks in my life,

331
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,527
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

332
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,167
There are type two,
type three, type four.

333
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,722
Type fours don't last very long.

334
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,122
So that's how it popped 
into my head.

335
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,970
If there is someone like me
in the world,

336
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,128
and I'm at one end of the spectrum,

337
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,643
couldn't there be someone else
the opposite of me at the other end?

338
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,404
Someone who doesn't get sick,

339
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,211
who doesn't get hurt
like the rest of us?

340
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,887
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

341
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,881
The kind of person
these stories are about.

342
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,410
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

343
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,005
To guard us.

344
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,243
You think my dad's a real...

345
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,688
I don't think anything right now.

346
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,047
It's a possibility...

347
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,361
...one with many holes.

348
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,850
Joseph, don't take another sip
of that water.

349
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,011
Go throw it in the trash.

350
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,850
- But, Dad...
- Do it now, please.

351
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,445
[door opens]

352
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,251
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

353
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,367
[door closes]

354
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,722
You find someone
you want to take advantage of,

355
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,287
you tell them a fantastic story,

356
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,284
and somewhere in there
you say it:

357
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,204
"I just need
your credit card number...

358
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,124
...a small down payment."

359
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,405
This morning was the first morning
I could remember

360
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,881
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

361
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,246
...sadness.

362
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,008
I thought the person who wrote
that note had an answer for me.

363
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,730
[door opens]

364
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,127
[footsteps approach]

365
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,325
I'm gonna leave now.

366
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,088
Good luck with your exhibition.

367
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,248
So, what kind of job
do you have, David?

368
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,800
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

369
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,644
What exactly is it that you do?

370
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,169
I work at the university stadium.
I'm a security guard.

371
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,605
[door opens]

372
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,166
[knock on door]

373
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,244
[knocking continues]

374
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,640
Hi.

375
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,564
I've come to a decision.

376
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,485
OK.

377
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,931
I just want to ask you
something, OK?

378
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,368
And you can be totally honest.

379
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:59,849
I'm prepared for any answer,
and it won't affect me.

380
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,605
Have you been with anyone?

381
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,921
I mean, since we've been
having problems.

382
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,604
The answer won't affect me.

383
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,084
I just need to know, you know?

384
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,606
It won't affect me either way.

385
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,726
No.

386
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,204
[inhales sharply]

387
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,766
[sobbing] Sorry, David. Sorry.

388
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,121
Anyway...

389
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,964
...my decision is...

390
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,286
[sniffles]

391
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,283
...that I want to start again.

392
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,651
That I want it to be like it was
in the beginning.

393
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,645
And it's a big deal that you
walked away from that train.

394
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,721
I feel like it's a second chance.

395
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,087
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime,

396
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,730
it'd be OK.

397
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,845
OK.

398
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,808
- [marching band playing]
- [man speaking indistinctly on PA]

399
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,366
- [man on walkie-talkie] Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.

400
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,890
It's Jenkins.

401
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,043
Look, we got a guy over
at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.

402
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:44,091
Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.

403
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,646
What's he look like?

404
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,409
Why is it, do you think,

405
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,929
that, of all the professions
in the world, you chose protection?

406
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,923
You are a very strange man.

407
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,890
You could have been a tax accountant,
owned your own gym,

408
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,720
opened a chain of restaurants.
You could've done one of 10,000 things,

409
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,885
but in the end,
you chose to protect people.

410
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,769
You made that decision,

411
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,684
and I find that
very, very interesting.

412
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,804
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

413
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,803
That last part was a joke.

414
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,730
[David chuckles]

415
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,008
You're a big sports fan, are you?

416
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,725
It's starting to intrigue me.

417
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,564
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

418
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,802
[man] Program here. Program.

419
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,120
Program.

420
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,921
Program.

421
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,647
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

422
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,121
- Just give me a minute.
- ls there a problem?

423
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,806
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
have to search you.

424
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,281
The tall guy in
the camouflage jacket.

425
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,045
Sometimes people
carry weapons in here,

426
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,048
and they drink too much.

427
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,324
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

428
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,121
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

429
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,641
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

430
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,850
Yeah, step right up here.

431
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,290
[coughs]

432
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,086
[David] OK.

433
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,846
I got you a seat
up in the yellow section.

434
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,206
It's in the nosebleeds,

435
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,807
but at least you won't get spit on.

436
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,041
All right.

437
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,363
How'd you know that guy you bumped
was carrying a weapon?

438
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,841
I don't know.

439
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,244
Maybe it was that camouflage
army jacket he was wearing.

440
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,767
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

441
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,286
You thought
he was carrying a knife?

442
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,800
I thought he was
carrying something, yeah.

443
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,205
But not a knife.

444
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,487
I got a...

445
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,524
...picture of a silver gun
with a black grip

446
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,841
tucked in his pants.

447
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,366
You know, like on TV.

448
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:33,570
You have good instincts
for things like that?

449
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,766
Like what?

450
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:38,003
Knowing when people
have done something wrong.

451
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,760
Yeah.

452
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,690
Have you ever tried to develop it?

453
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,041
I don't know what you're asking me.

454
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,326
Your skill.

455
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,849
Look, I got to be down
on the sidelines during the game.

456
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,882
You can get to your seat
right down...

457
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,129
Characters in comics are often
attributed special powers...

458
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,524
Invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

459
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,403
OK.

460
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,086
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

461
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,731
It's an exaggeration of the truth.

462
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,930
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

463
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,480
But he might not have been
carrying anything.

464
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,881
But he might have been
carrying a silver gun

465
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,888
with a black grip tucked 
in his pants.

I gotta go-

468
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,402
Yeah, I know. I'll be right down.

469
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,848
- One last question.
- What?

470
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:34,970
That car accident you were in.
Was there anyone else involved?

471
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,848
Yeah. My wife Audrey.

472
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,161
She was in the car with me.

473
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,201
Have a good life, Elijah.

474
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,370
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

480
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,926
The city council has stepped up
plans to pass a bill

00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,760
Dad!

491
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,131
Joseph, do you know how mad
your mother would be

492
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,886
- if she knew you were playing football?
- Are you gonna tell?

493
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,727
You want to play last set of downs?
We got a big guy like you.

494
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,121
You could play on opposite sides.

495
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,850
He's Potter's cousin.

496
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,685
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

497
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,649
He's going pro in the draft.

498
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:18,241
They say he can run
the 40 in 4.3 seconds.

499
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:20,243
I've heard.

500
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,324
You can beat him, Dad.
Let's beat 'em.

501
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,731
I'm gonna go in.

502
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,485
Just one set of downs.
I told them you were great.

503
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,688
- Why'd you do that?
- Just one.

504
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:32,047
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

505
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,726
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

506
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,842
- I'll help you.
- I don't need...

507
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,924
I can't play, guys!
I'm working outwith my dad!

508
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,488
Hut! You're doing good.

509
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,851
Right there! Catch!

[Gregg Allman: Midnight Rider]

How much did you put on there?

512
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,364
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

513
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,927
How much can you lift?

514
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,526
That's the most I ever lifted.

515
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,087
That could've been dangerous, Joseph.

516
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,243
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, OK?

517
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:33,244
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,248
No.

520
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,762
- I mean, if you knew karate.
- No.

521
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:55,208
What if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

No, Joseph.

I lied.

526
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,290
You added?

How much is it?

528
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,646
Two hundred and seventy pounds.

You should never do
anything like this.

You know that, right?

All of it.

About 350 pounds.

as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

The worst of the injury

549
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,448
was sustained to the right leg
in the form of a spiral fracture.

550
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,563
There were 14 breaks.
It simply shattered.

- Kids.

[doctor] Are you all right, Mr. Price?
Shall I continue?

Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

555

The use of a wheelchair will be
needed for a two-month period.

556
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,684
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

Hospital stay will range
from five to eight days

Oh.

to tell me more.

[chuckles softly]

576
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,682
My husband
was a star athlete in college,

577
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,081
and we were
in an accident together.

578
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,845
Our car flipped on an icy road,
we were both injured.

If that hadn't happened,

we wouldn't have been together.

How so?

582
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,448
I think we should
talk about your rehab.

583
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,683
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

584
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,685
So tell me more
about the quad machine.

585
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:22,364
It prevents atrophy by...
I couldn't spend my life

586
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:26,889
with someone who played football.
It's pretty much that simple.

587
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,328
I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

588
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,410
Like everyone else, I was in awe
of the way he played it,

589
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:38,520
but football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

590
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,444
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

591
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:45,929
It's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,567
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but...

593
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,644
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident

594
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,166
and took football
out of the equation.

595
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:58,687
And everyone lived happily ever after.

596
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,490
Sort of.

He is unharmed.

612
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:25,684
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

613
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,604
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

614
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,843
Since then, I've come
to believe that possibility,

615
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,482
however unbelievable,
is now more a probability.

616

And what was it you suggested?

These are mediocre times,
Mrs. Dunn.

It's hard for many to believe

00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:49,811
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

620

Can you step out of line, please?

- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.

He wants you
to come down there.

Is that your dad?

642

I bet my dad
could beat up your dad.

643

No. He...
he insisted we call only you,

644

tracking you down.

ointment on him or anything?

649
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,762
No, no. It's more 
emotional damage,

650

Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

When was that?

My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

No, ma'am.

Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

658

Did you know that we changed

659
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:23,450
the rules of conduct
around the pool because of you?

660

The kids still tell about it
like it was some sort of ghost story.

nearly drowned in that pool?

He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes,

he was dead."

[Joseph] It was Potter

They were messing with this
Chinese girl in the dressing room.

You can't let bad things happen
to good people, right?

669
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:15,970
That's your code, right?

670
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,008
That's the hero's code.

671
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:22,962
I tried to make them stop,
but they kept pushing me down,

672

and they wouldn't let 
me get back up.

00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,406
I thought maybe
'cause you're my dad...

00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,882
...I thought I might be like you.

I'm not like you.

00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,208
You are like me.

- No, you're not.

Why do you keep saying that?

He didn't do anything.
He just...

...told me his theory.

684

That's sad,
when patients get like that.

685
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:21,730

You don't believe. I'll show

You won't get hurt.

- He was with me when I met him.
- No one believes him.

Joseph, listen to me.

Sometimes when people

Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

You're right.

716
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:53,329
If you pull that trigger,
that bullet will bounce off me,

717
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:56,682
and I'm not going to be hurt,
but then I'm going to go upstairs

and I'm going to pack and
I'm going to leave for New York.

Why?

720
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,771
Because I thought we were just
starting to be friends for real,

721
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,525
and friends will listen to each other.
They don't...

And they don't shoot each other,
do they, Audrey?

tucked in the back of his pants.

Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

734

Because I believe you faked it.

to end your football career,

806
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,445
[exhales deeply]

807
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,085
Don't know for sure.

808
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:39,610
Think carefully.

809
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,202
What about the game?

810
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,203
It's over. I won.

811
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:49,442
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

812
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:50,851
Maybe it was a time...

813
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,364
I had a nightmare one night, and...

814
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,649
I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was OK.

815
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,648
I think that was the first time.

816
01:09:05,960 --> 01:09:07,405
Does that count?

817
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,051
That counts.

818
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,080
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

819
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,324
Yes.

820
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,243
Why?

821
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,130
I don't know.

822
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,884
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

823
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,166
Something's...

824
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:47,885
...just not right.

825
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,489
Do you resent us, David?

826
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:56,520
Resent the life you have?

827
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:02,166
There were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

828
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,208
These were your choices.

829
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,685
Even if it meant
we couldn't have been together,

830
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:15,048
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

831
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:19,051
What you could do physically
was a gift.

832
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,283
I never would've wished it
to go away.

833
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,083
You know that, right?

834
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,882
You had two calls
after Joseph went to bed.

835
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,402
One came through while I was on the
other line, but I wasn't talking long.

836
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,405
There was an emergency with my sister.
She tried to do a perm, and she looks...

837
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,562
Who called through?

838
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,687
Um...

839
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,327
Someone from New York,
about a security job.

840
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,561
They want to hire you.

841
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:50,881
I didn't know you guys
were moving to New York.

842
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,524
Thanks for telling me.

843
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,643
We weren't all gonna move.

844
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:58,006
Oh.

845
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:04,402
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

846
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,082
[rain falling outside]

847
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:09,360
Great.

848
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:25,725
Look, let's just be honest here.
We're just at the beginning,

849
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:28,730
and I don't expect you 
or I to change

850
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:31,161
the course of where our lives
were headed

851
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:33,720
because of one date.

852
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:35,728
And if you do go to New York,

853
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,324
we can develop this. We'll just 
be forced to take it slow.

854
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:45,166
And in the end, I think 
that's definitely better.

855
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,363
This is our second time 
around, David.

856
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,683
I didn't expect us to get
carried away, you know.

857
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:58,088
Then I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

858
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:25,808
- [beeps]
- David, it's Elijah.

859
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,845
It was so obvious. It was this one issue
that brought it back for me...

860
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,771
Century Comics 117. That's where
this group, the Coalition of Evil,

861
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:37,003
tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero,

862
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:40,289
because they all have one,
just like you.

863
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,244
Your bones don't break. Mine do.

864
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,646
That's clear.

865
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:48,162
Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.

866
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:50,368
You don't get sick. I do.

867
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,289
That's also clear.

868
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:53,805
But for some reason,

869
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,606
you and I react
the exact same way to water.

870
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,001
We swallow it too 
fast, we choke.

871
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,441
We get some in our 
lungs, we drown.

872
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:07,481
However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.

873
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,727
We're on the same curve,

874
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,206
just on opposite ends.

875
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:16,564
The point of all this is we now know
something we didn't.

876
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,722
You have a weakness...

877
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,091
...water.

878
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:23,050
It's like your kryptonite.

879
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,043
You hearing me, David?

880
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:27,605
[beeps]

881
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,565

01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:41,845
Audrey?

- [metal creaking]
- [straining]

885
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,610
Gotcha.

886
01:16:17,680 --> 01:16:19,091
Come on.

887
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,801
Audrey.

888
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:38,881
Audrey.

889
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,131
Hey!

890
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,170
Audrey.

891
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,011
What happened?

892
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,570
What happened?

893
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:58,965
I thought I was...

894
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,486
I thought I was dead.

895
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:02,971
Me too.

896
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:08,129
[truck door slams shut]

897
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,043
Is she all right?

898
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,646
I think her leg's broken.

899
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,121
Are you hurt?

900
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,601
Hey, man, are you hurt?

901
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,528
[phone ringing]

902
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,762
Hello?

903
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,485
[David] I wasn't injured
in that car accident.

904
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:53,641
David.

905
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,330
I've never been injured, Elijah.

906
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,330
<i>What</i> am <i>I supposed to do?</i>

907
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:10,647
Go to where people are.

908
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:14,643
You won't have to look 
very long.

909
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,169
It's all right to be 
afraid, David,

910
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:23,165
because this part
won't be like a comic book.

911
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:27,968
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

912
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,048
There's one in the first row.

913
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,606
It's... it's the second one.

914
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:13,411
Yes. It's the second one over.

915
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,210
- [screams]
- Go back to Africa!

[tires screech]

917
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,480
Hey, what's your name?

918
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:15,964
I think you drank too much.

919
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,007
Can I come in?

920
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,525
Who are you?

921
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,444
I like your house.

922
01:21:08,520 --> 01:21:10,409
Can I come in?

923
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:11,891
What is this?

924
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,848
No. You can't come in.

925
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,365
Are you sure?

926
01:21:20,440 --> 01:21:22,568
What... what are you...?

It's over now.

[David] I don't know.

951
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,643
I can't believe you'd 
think that.

952
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:36,722
I'm just asking you.

953

I'm making French toast.

954
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:01,281
I've been thinking about 
Elijah Price.

955
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,166
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, OK?

956
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:10,246
OK?

957
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:14,726
OK.

This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

962
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,081
See the villain's eyes?

963
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,606
They're larger
than the other characters'.

964
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:27,803
They insinuate a slightly
skewed perspective

965
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:31,123
on how they see the world...

966
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,441
...just off normal.

967
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:35,801
He doesn't look scary.

968
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:40,966
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son,
but he says there's always two kinds.

969
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:43,281
There's the soldier villain

970
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:47,291
who fights the hero with his hands,
and then there's the real threat,

971
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:50,284
the brilliant and 
evil archenemy

972
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,971
who fights the hero
with his mind.

973
01:36:53,040 --> 01:36:56,328
- Are you Elijah's mother?
- I am.

974
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,641
I'm helping him with the sale.

975
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:01,530
Nice to meet you.
I'm David Dunn.

976
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,568
He's spoken of you.

977
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:07,122
- Says you're becoming friends.
- We are.

978
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,563
Looks like he's doing good today.

979
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:14,484
I'm very proud of him.

980
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,723
He's come through a 
lot in his life,

981
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:21,407
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

982
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:22,686
Mm-hmm.

983
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,205
They were bad...

984
01:37:25,640 --> 01:37:28,246
...but he made it.

985
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,810
Yes, he did.

986
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:33,926
He's kind of a miracle.

987
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,370
Yes, he is.

988
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:44,130
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

989
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:16,042
It has begun.

990
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,208
Tell me something, David.

991
01:38:22,520 --> 01:38:24,727
When you woke up this morning,

992
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,167
was it still there?

993
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:28,690
The sadness?

994
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:31,525
No.

995
01:38:32,720 --> 01:38:33,846
[exhales]

996
01:38:35,680 --> 01:38:39,605
I think this is
where we shake hands.

997
01:38:54,200 --> 01:38:56,771
- [explosion]
- [gasping]

998
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:01,806
Did you see it?

999
01:39:04,120 --> 01:39:08,011
- [sirens wailing]
- [alarm buzzing]

1000
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:12,765
I worked in that building 
25 years.

1001
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,280
I know all its secrets.

1002
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,651
Secrets?

1003
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:24,602
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three,

1004
01:39:24,680 --> 01:39:27,411
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

1005
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,329
- [sirens wailing]
- [alarm buzzing]

1006
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,846
Passengers aren't allowed 
in there.

1007
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:40,168
[train rattling]

1008
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:45,166
[gasps]

1009
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:23,083
[Elijah] Do you know
what the scariest thing is?

1010
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:29,843
To not know your place 
in this world,

1011
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:34,687
to not know why you're here.
That's...

1012
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:39,887
That's just an awful feeling.

1013
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,527
What have you done?

1014
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:47,809
I almost gave up hope.

1015
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:51,242
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

1016
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:53,687
You killed all those people.

1017
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,891
But I found you.

1018
01:40:57,960 --> 01:41:01,203
So many sacrifices...

1019
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,409
...just to find you.

1020
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,084
Jesus Christ.

1021
01:41:16,400 --> 01:41:20,121
Now that we know who you are,

1022
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,925
I know who I am.

1023
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,727
I'm not a mistake.

1024
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:32,408
It all makes sense.

1025
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:36,246
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

1026
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,762
He's the exact opposite 
of the hero,

1027
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,407
and most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

1028
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:48,411
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

1029
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:50,408
Because of the kids.

1030
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:03,324
They called me Mr. Glass.
